# The-Effects-of-COVID-19----Unstructured-Data---Spark-SQL---AWS-S3
The project aimed to analyze mask-usage to identify compliance effects in high-risk areas and analyze vaccination trends between states.

Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire world, and the United States is no exception. The goal of this project was to identify high-risk states for COVID-19 outbreaks and find potential solutions to reduce the risk. In addition, the project aimed to analyze mask-usage to identify compliance effects in high-risk areas and analyze vaccination trends between states.

To achieve these goals, data was collected from various sources, including government websites, news outlets, and academic publications. The data was analyzed using statistical methods, and visualizations were created to aid in the interpretation of the results.

The analysis revealed several high-risk states for COVID-19 outbreaks, with factors such as population density, demographic composition, and economic activity playing a significant role. Potential solutions to reduce the risk included increased testing, contact tracing, and targeted vaccination campaigns.

The analysis of mask-usage showed a positive correlation between compliance and lower rates of COVID-19 transmission in high-risk areas. However, there were some challenges in enforcing mask mandates, especially in states with political and cultural resistance to wearing masks.

Finally, the analysis of vaccination trends showed significant variation between states, with some states lagging in vaccination rates due to supply constraints, misinformation, and vaccine hesitancy.

Overall, this project provides insights into the complex factors influencing COVID-19 outbreaks and the effectiveness of interventions. The findings can inform public health policy and guide future research on mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Business Problems

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the lives of people all over the world. To understand the impact of the virus and identify areas of high risk, we conducted an in-depth analysis of various business problems related to COVID-19.

Our first task was to identify areas of high risk for COVID-19 outbreaks. To accomplish this, we conducted an analysis of several factors. By using this information, we were able to identify areas that were more likely to experience outbreaks of the virus. This information proved invaluable in identifying potential solutions to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 in those areas.

Next, we analyzed mask usage to identify areas where people were more or less likely to wear masks. We compared this information to the areas we had identified as high-risk for COVID-19 outbreaks. This information had the ability to highlight the importance of promoting mask usage in areas of high risk to prevent the spread of the virus.

Lastly, we analyzed vaccination trends between different states. We obtained data on the number of vaccinations administered in each state and compared this to the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. This analysis allowed us to perform a time series of vaccination and testing versus the death rate for the COVID-19 virus. By doing so, we were able to identify the potential cause and effect relationship between the problems at hand.

Our analysis of various business problems related to COVID-19 allowed us to gain a comprehensive understanding of the impact of the virus and identify potential solutions to mitigate its spread. By identifying areas of high risk, analyzing mask usage, and examining vaccination trends, we were able to perform a time series analysis that revealed valuable insights into the relationship between vaccination and the spread of the virus. The insights gained from our analysis will be discussed throughout this report and have the potential to inform public health policy and improve decision-making in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

Background & Motivation

The COVID-19 pandemic has been a significant global business problem, with far-reaching effects on economies, businesses, and individuals. To understand the impact of the virus, it is essential to analyze its effects on various areas, including business, public health, and social systems. The analysis of COVID-19 data is essential to identify areas of high risk and develop potential solutions to mitigate the potential of risk in those areas.

The motivation for analyzing high-risk areas is to identify potential interventions that can reduce the spread of the virus and protect individuals and communities. By analyzing mask usage in high-risk areas, researchers can gain insights into the effectiveness of public health messaging and interventions. The analysis of vaccination trends between different states is also important in identifying areas that may need additional resources or support to ensure that they receive the vaccine.

The time series analysis of vaccination and testing versus death rate for COVID-19 is crucial in understanding the cause-and-effect relationship between these factors. By analyzing this data, researchers can identify trends and patterns that may help in developing effective interventions and public health policies.

Overall, the analysis of COVID-19 data is crucial for identifying areas of high risk and developing effective interventions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. This analysis can help businesses, governments, and individuals make informed decisions to protect themselves and their communities, reduce the spread of the virus, and ultimately save lives.
